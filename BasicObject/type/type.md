# mro

the [C3 superclass linearization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C3_linearization) is implemented in python for Method Resolution Order (MRO) after python2.3, prior to python2.3, the Method Resolution Order is a Depth-First, Left-to-Right algorithm

for those who are interested in detail, please refer to [Amit Kumar: Demystifying Python Method Resolution Order - PyCon APAC 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuonAMJjHow&t=400s)

## before python2.3

let's define an example

	from __future__ import print_function

    class A(object):
        pass

    class B(object):
        def who(self):
            print("I am B")

    class C(object):
        pass

    class D(A, B):
        pass

    class E(B, C):
        def who(self):
            print("I am E")

    class F(D, E):
        pass

![mro_ hierarchy](https://github.com/zpoint/CPython-Internals/blob/master/BasicObject/type/mro_hierarchy.png)

the **mro** order implementation before python2.3 is a Depth-First, Left-Most algorithm

mro of **D** is computed as `DAB`

mro of **E** is computed as `EBC`

mro of **F** is computed as `FDABEC`

	# ./python2.2
	>>> f = F()
	>>> f.who() # B is in front of E
	I am B

## after python2.3

the **merge** part of the **C3** algorithm can be simply summarized as the following steps

* take the head of the first list
* if this head is not in the tail of any of the other lists, then add it to the linearization of C and remove it from the lists in the merge
* otherwise look at the head of the next list and take it, if it is a good head
* then repeat the operation until all the class are removed or it is impossible to find good heads(the inherted order need to be monotonous, or the algorithm won't terminate, for more detail please refer to the first video in [read more](#read-more))

mro of **D** is computed as

	D + merge(L(A), L(B), AB)
    D + merge(A, B, AB)
    # A is the head of the next list, and not the tail of any other list, take A out, remove A in the lists in the merge
    D + A + merge(B, B)
    # the first element is the list is the head, not the tail, so B is taken
    D + A + B

mro of **E** is computed as

	E + merge(L(B), L(C), BC)
    E + merge(B, C, BC)
    E + B + merge(C, C)
    E + B + C

mro of **F** is computed as

	F + merge(L(D), L(E), BC)
    F + merge(DAB, EBC, DE)
    F + D + merge(AB, EBC, E)
    F + D + A + merge(B, EBC, E)
    # B is now in the tail of the second list, the head of the second list is "E"
    # tail is "BC", so B can't be taken, next head E will be taken
    F + D + A + E + merge(B, BC)
    F + D + A + E + B + C

	# ./python2.3
	>>> f = F()
	>>> f.who() # E is in front of B
	I am E

## difference bwtween python2 and python3

in the following code

	from __future__ import print_function

    class A:
        pass

    class B:
        def who(self):
            print("I am B")

    class C:
        pass

    class D(A, B):
        pass

    class E(B, C):
        def who(self):
            print("I am E")

    class F(D, E):
        pass

in python2, class `A`, `B`,`C`, `D`, and `E` are not inherted from the `object`, even after python2.3, objects not inherted from `object` will not use the **C3** algorithm for **MRO**, the old style Depth-First, Left-Most algorithm will be used

	# ./python2.7
	>>> f = F()
	>>> f.who() # B is in front of E
	I am B


while in python3, they both implicit inherted from `object`, objects inherted from `object` use the **C3** algorithm for **MRO**

	# ./python3
	>>> f = F()
	>>> f.who() # E is in front of B
	I am E

# creation of class

if we `dis` the above code

     26          96 LOAD_BUILD_CLASS
                 98 LOAD_CONST              12 (<code object F at 0x10edf4150, file "mro.py", line 26>)
                100 LOAD_CONST              13 ('F')
                102 MAKE_FUNCTION            0
                104 LOAD_CONST              13 ('F')
                106 LOAD_NAME                6 (D)
                108 LOAD_NAME                7 (E)
                110 CALL_FUNCTION            4
                112 STORE_NAME               8 (F)

`LOAD_BUILD_CLASS` simply pushes the function `__build_class__` to stack

and the following opcodes push all the variables `__build_class__` needed to stack

`110 CALL_FUNCTION            4` calls the `__build_class__` to generate the class

the `__build_class__`  will find the `metaclass`, `name`, `bases`, and `ns`(namespace) and delegates the call to `metaclass.__call__` attribute

for example, the `class F`

	metaclass: <class 'type'>
	name: 'F'
    bases: (<class '__main__.D'>, <class '__main__.E'>)
    ns: {'__module__': '__main__', '__qualname__': 'F'}, cls: <class '__main__.F'>

in the example `class F`, what does `<class 'type'>.__call__` do ?

the function is defined in `cpython/Objects/typeobject.c`

prototype is `static PyObject *type_call(PyTypeObject *type, PyObject *args, PyObject *kwds)`

we can draw the following procedure according to the source code

![creation_of_class](https://github.com/zpoint/CPython-Internals/blob/master/BasicObject/type/creation_of_class.png)

# creation of instance

if we add the following line to the tail of the above codes

	f = F()

we can find other snippet of the `dis` result


     31         130 LOAD_NAME                9 (F)
                132 CALL_FUNCTION            0
                134 STORE_NAME              10 (f)

it simply calls the `__call__` attribute of `F`


    >>> F.__call__
    <method-wrapper '__call__' of type object at 0x7fa5fa725ec8>

![creation_of_instance](https://github.com/zpoint/CPython-Internals/blob/master/BasicObject/type/creation_of_instance.png)

# metaclass

in the above procedures, we can learn that **metaclass** controls the creation of a **class**, the creation of **instance** doesn't invoke the **metaclass**, it just calls the `__call__` attribute of the class to create the instance

![difference_between_class_instance](https://github.com/zpoint/CPython-Internals/blob/master/BasicObject/type/difference_between_class_instance.png)

we can change the behaviour of a class on the fly by manually define a **metaclass**


    class MyMeta(type):
        def __new__(mcs, name, bases, attrs, **kwargs):
            if F in bases:
                return F

            newly_created_cls = super().__new__(mcs, name, bases, attrs)
            if "Animal" in name:
                newly_created_cls.leg = 4
            else:
                newly_created_cls.leg = 0
            return newly_created_cls


    class Animal1(metaclass=MyMeta):
        pass


    class Normal(metaclass=MyMeta):
        pass


    class AnotherF(F, metaclass=MyMeta):
        pass


    print(Animal1.leg) # 4
    print(Normal.leg)  # 0
    print(AnotherF)  # <class '__main__.F'>

pretty fun!
