This repository is my notes/blog for [cpython](https://github.com/python/cpython) source code

Trying to illustrate every detail of cpython implementation

```shell script
# based on version 3.8.0a0
cd cpython
git reset --hard ab54b9a130c88f708077c2ef6c4963b632c132b3

```

The following contents are suitable for those who have python programming experience and interested in internal of python interpreter, for those who needs beginner or advanced material please refer to [awesome-python-books](https://github.com/Junnplus/awesome-python-books)

# Grammar

I will come back to this part when I finish reading [< < Compilers > >](https://www.amazon.com/Compilers-Principles-Techniques-Tools-2nd/dp/0321486811) and [< < SICP > >](https://www.amazon.com/Structure-Interpretation-Computer-Programs-Engineering/dp/0262510871) and have a better understanding of this kind of stuffs

In the meantime, my routine work will have a higher priority, so you may need months to see updates in this part
